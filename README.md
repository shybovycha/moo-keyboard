# MooKeyboard - swipe ergonomic keyboard for Android

![screenshot](https://github.com/shybovycha/moo-keyboard/blob/master/Screenshot_20240925_220934.png)

This keyboard was inspired by MessagEase, which recently became a subscription-based (and a rather annoying at that, to be frank) application.

It is more of a fun pet project rather than a real-world usable application.

Currently it is subject to the following limitations:

* only one fixed layout
* only capital English letters
* no settings
* symbol layer is not implemented
